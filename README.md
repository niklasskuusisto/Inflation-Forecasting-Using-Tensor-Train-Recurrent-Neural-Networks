This repository contains the empirical work for my M.Sc. thesis in Economics at Aalto University School of Business, submitted in 2023. In the work inflation forecasting using TT-RNNs is explored. 

In the repository all of the data is provided in the "Data" folder and any data pre-processing as well as the implementations of the models are provided in "Code" folder.
